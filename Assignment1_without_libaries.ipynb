The latter point seems especially called for given the delicate stance that degrowth takes, or seems to take, towards, some of the main tenets of ‘orthodox’ (or ‘mainstream’) economic theory (cf. Hickel, 2021). In addition, we use a network analysis approach of bibliometric data through co-authorships to identify influential authors and clusters of close collaboration. This mixed-methods approach with a firm base in multivariate statistics also provides an alternative to other recent reviews of the filed that have focused exclusively on qualitative clustering methods (Fitzpatrick et al.,2022; Kallis et al.,2018; Weiss and Cattaneo,2017). Our paper proceeds as follows. After clarifying the key concepts such as d ecroissance, stationary economy degrowth in Section 2, we give a detailed overview on our methods used in Section 3. Section 4 presents our results, before we discuss them in Section 5 and draw some conclusions in section 6. We clarify the most important concepts relevant in the degrowth discourse in the following. In the particular, we follow Martinez-Alier et al. (Martinez-Alier et al., 2010) in distinguishing between the French approach to degrowth, i.e. d ecroissance or ‘degrowth ‘a la Francaise’, and degrowth in ecological economics. Here, we review the first 15 years of degrowth research as published in academic peer-reviewed journals. Specifically, we analyze all peer-reviewed research referring to degrowth or post growth in title, keywords or abstract that was published from 2008 through 2022 as an English language journal article. (henceforth: degrowth literature1). In particular, using a mixed-methods approach, we address the following four research gaps: (1) we use as inductive multivariate statistical procedure to identify the main clusters within the degrowth literature and to map the conceptual landscape of degrowth; (2) we provide a quantitative account of which journals and authors cater to what cluster; (3) we provide a network analysis of co-authorship in the field; (4) we provide a qualitative analysis of distributional and monetary policy proposals brought forward in the degrowth literature. Our clustering procedure, which is itself inspired by plant ecology’s indictor species analysis (Dufrene and Legendre, 1997), is well established and has proven suitable for relatively young scientific fields or concepts that have seen a deep rise in popularity, such as ecosystem services (Abson et al.,2014), sustainability economics (Drupp et al\"\n",
